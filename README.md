# Code-With-Us

**General Overview** - Code With Us is a technical forum/chat/information sharing service that allows learners and teachers alike to communicate with each other about all things related to code. 

## Features
**Developers/Users** - Developers are the backbone of any board. Developers have many options available.
* Registration - Fully customisable registration process for developers
* Developers Online List - If enabled, Code-With-Us can list all of the developers who are currently online
* Developer Profile Settings - Developers can customise their profile and add additional information such as an email address or IM and social media accounts
* Avatars - Avatars are a personal image displayed above the developers username on a post and in their profile. If avatars are enabled, each Developer can customise their own
* Ranks - Developers and group specific ranks are available and fully customisable. Ranks display under a developer's username in a post or in their profile

**Forums** - Forums make up the organisational structure of the board.
* Posting - The primary purpose of Code-With-Us is to facilitate discussion via posting subjects and threads
* Subforums - Code-With-Us allows for an unlimited number of subforums in the hierarchical structure
* Flat Topic Structure - Code-With-Us utilises a flat topic and post structure, rather than threaded
* Private Message System - Developers have the ability to send messages to one another directly via ??
* Contact Page - Visitors, including guests, can get in touch with the one of the Code-With-Us administrators for additional support

**Moderators** - Moderators help maintain order by assisting developers and enforcing the rules.
* Global Moderators - A Global Moderator immediately has access to moderation tasks for all forums on the board.
* Forum Moderators - Moderators can be assigned to individual forums on a per-developer or per-group basis.
* Manage Ranks - Add, edit, or remove Developer and group ranks. Customise the images displayed or the number of posts necessary to achieve a certain rank.

**Security**
* Password Hashing - All passwords are entirely hashed before stored in the database, so you can be sure they're secure
